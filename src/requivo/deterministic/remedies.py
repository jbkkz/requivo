"""The card-selection remedy: one finding, shared by `doctor` and `session verify`, which both ask
independently whether a session's persisted `context_cards` selection still loads. Until #556
`doctor.py` defined it and `session verify` imported it from there -- a verb module reaching into a
sibling verb module's private names. Cost of two copies: `doctor` and `session verify` printing
different advice for the same finding, the quiet-wrong-answer shape #40 is about."""

# Which card findings are repaired by *restoring a file*, and which by *fixing the stored selection*.
# Two different remedies, and printing the first under the second is the quiet-wrong-answer form of
# the bug #40 is about: the verb names a real problem and then tells you to do something that cannot
# fix it. Stated once and read by both surfaces, because `doctor` and `session verify` printing
# different advice for the same finding is how they drift.
#
# `context_unreadable` is deliberately NOT a member, for the same reason `_SELECTION_REFUSALS` in
# `core/context.py` deliberately excludes it: `check_selection` lets it propagate rather than
# returning it, so `_card_health` reports it as `{"checked": False, "problem": None}` and it can
# never arrive here as a `problem["code"]` at all. Listing it would be a branch that cannot run,
# which reads to the next person as coverage this does not have. The pair is pinned by
# `test_the_two_card_code_tables_agree`, so adding it to the refusals tuple later fails loudly here
# instead of silently routing a permissions fault to the wrong remedy.

def _card_health(slug: str) -> dict:
    """Does this session's persisted context-card selection still load *here*? Three states, because
    a checker that could not look must not answer like one that looked and found nothing:

    - `{"checked": True,  "problem": None}`  — it loads;
    - `{"checked": True,  "problem": {…}}`   — it does not, and the envelope names the cards;
    - `{"checked": False, "error": "…"}`     — neither the session's metadata nor the card directory
      could be read, so this session's context is simply unknown.

    **Why this lives here and not in `core/integrity.py`.** That module answers one question — does
    a session directory tell the truth *about itself* — and a context card is not in the directory;
    it is in the installed package or in `user_context_dir()`. Reporting a lost card as an integrity
    problem would make the same directory coherent on one machine and broken on another, which is
    not a property an integrity check can have. It would also break `session import`, which refuses
    an archive on exactly those problems: a colleague's perfectly good session would become
    unimportable because you happen not to have one of their cards. So it is an *environment*
    finding, reported by the two verbs that ask about the environment — `doctor` and
    `session verify` — over `core.context.check_selection`, which is the guard `load_context`
    itself applies rather than a second implementation of it.
